# Thoughts on Markham

As a small child, I used to walk by Markham Civic Centre sometimes with my parents. Staring then at Highway 7 and Town Centre Boulevard, I could only see a faded zebra crosswalk and a single blue sign for the Viva bus route. Staring now, there is now a dedicated bus lane and two sidewalks for bikes and pedestrians respectively. To say that the Markham of the past couple of years has changed would be an understatement. Large city events were once held in the parking lot of Markham Town Hall, while they're now held in the middle of Downtown Markham. Where once the sprawling suburbia of single-family homes dominated, there were now apartments within a kilometer of mixed-use developments.

Looking back now, I feel like I took for granted granted the way city grew both infrastructure-wise but also culturally. New students from new cities and countries poured into my classes every year without the systematic discrimination that so many face moving to other cities and countries. This isn't to say that there weren't any problems on this front - anybody who's been inside a school can tell stories that make you lose faith in the goodness of humanity.

The diversity thats slowly flowing into the city beyond just the predominant East Asian community will likely drive the city growing into the future. Perhaps I've been lucky, but I have never encountered a situation where somebody has been yelled at for talking a language other than English. People hold pride in maintaining their individuality while integrating into Canadian society.

This pride in tradition is also reflected in the restauraunts dotted along the area. From the familiar smell of a _cha chaan teng_ that's been there longer than I've lived to the massive mountains of Indian food in the cafeterias dotting Denison, I've only been greeted by people proud to share their food and culture with someone who may not fully understand.

Though I may be leaving for now, I loved living in Markham for an amazing 18 years. The way that this city has and continues to grow in a sustainable way while preserving inclusivity has made me proud to call myself a resident.
